# Provider

The Cosmostation browser extension supports multiple blockchains and exposes
chain-specific providers for dApp integration.

This section describes how to integrate **Cosmostation Extension** with **Sui**,
using either the official **Sui dApp Kit** or plain (vanilla) JavaScript.

---

## Sui Provider

When the Cosmostation extension is installed, a **Sui-compatible wallet provider**
is injected into the browser.

This provider follows the Sui wallet standard and is designed to work seamlessly
with ecosystem tooling, including **Sui dApp Kit (`@mysten/dapp-kit`)**.

From a dApp’s perspective, Cosmostation behaves like any other standard Sui
wallet, allowing applications to remain wallet-agnostic.

---

## Sui dApp Kit (`@mysten/dapp-kit`)

**Sui dApp Kit** is the official React-oriented toolkit provided by Mysten Labs
for building Sui dApps.

Cosmostation is fully compatible with this toolkit.

When you integrate Cosmostation via the dApp Kit:

- Wallet discovery and selection are handled automatically
- Connection state and accounts are managed through React hooks
- Wallet features are accessed via standardized APIs
- No Cosmostation-specific branching logic is required

This allows your application to interoperate with **multiple Sui wallets**
through a single, unified interface.

The dApp Kit is especially suitable when you are building:

- React or Next.js based applications
- Production-grade Sui dApps
- Wallet-agnostic user experiences

### Official Documentation

For detailed API references, hooks, and architecture, refer to the official
Sui dApp Kit documentation:

- [Sui Wallet Standard docs](https://docs.sui.io/standards/wallet-standard#managing-wallets)

## Supported Features

Cosmostation’s Sui provider follows the **Sui wallet standard feature model**
and exposes the following capabilities.

| Category   | Feature Key                          | Version | Method / Entry                        | Description                                                                                                                         |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------ | ------: | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Connection | `standard:connect`                   | `1.0.0` | `connect()`                           | Establishes a connection with the wallet and returns the available `accounts` (address, publicKey, chains, and supported features). |
| Events     | `standard:events`                    | `1.0.0` | `on(event, handler)`                  | Subscribes to wallet events via the standard event interface.                                                                       |
| Signing    | `sui:signTransactionBlock`           | `1.0.0` | `signTransactionBlock(...)`           | Signs a Sui **TransactionBlock** payload without executing it.                                                                      |
| Signing    | `sui:signTransaction`                | `2.0.0` | `signTransaction(...)`                | Signs a Sui **Transaction** payload (v2 API).                                                                                       |
| Execute    | `sui:signAndExecuteTransactionBlock` | `1.0.0` | `signAndExecuteTransactionBlock(...)` | Signs and executes a **TransactionBlock** in one step.                                                                              |
| Execute    | `sui:signAndExecuteTransaction`      | `2.0.0` | `signAndExecuteTransaction(...)`      | Signs and executes a **Transaction** (v2 API) in one step.                                                                          |
| Message    | `sui:signMessage`                    | `1.0.0` | `signMessage(...)`                    | Signs an arbitrary message for off-chain authentication or verification.                                                            |
| Message    | `sui:signPersonalMessage`            | `2.0.0` | `signPersonalMessage(...)`            | Signs a personal-message format commonly used in wallet login flows.                                                                |

## Vanilla JavaScript Integration

If you choose not to use **Sui dApp Kit**, you can access the Sui provider
directly from the injected `window.cosmostation` object.

This approach is suitable for:

- Lightweight integrations
- Non-React environments
- Custom application architectures

### Accessing the Provider

```javascript
const sui = () => {
  if ('cosmostation' in window) {
    return window.cosmostation.sui;
  } else {
    window.open('https://cosmostation.io/wallet/#extension');
    /**
     * or:
     * window.open(
     *   'https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cosmostation/fpkhgmpbidmiogeglndfbkegfdlnajnf'
     * );
     */
  }
};

const provider = sui();
```

---

## Typical Use Cases

With the Sui provider, your dApp can:

- Request wallet connections
- Access the active Sui account
- Sign and execute transactions
- Sign messages for off-chain verification
- React to wallet-driven account changes

While the integration style differs between **dApp Kit** and **vanilla usage**,
the underlying wallet behavior remains consistent.
