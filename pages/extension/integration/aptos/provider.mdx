# Provider

The Cosmostation browser extension supports various blockchains and exposes chain-specific providers to enable seamless dApp integration.

This document describes how to integrate **Cosmostation Extension** with **Aptos**, using either the official Aptos Wallet Adapter or plain (vanilla) JavaScript.

---

## Aptos Wallet Adapter

Cosmostation fully implements the **Aptos Wallet Standard interface** defined by `aptos-labs`.

As a result, you can easily connect to the Cosmostation wallet by using the official **Aptos Wallet Adapter** packages provided by Aptos Labs, without any Cosmostation-specific code.

## Vanilla JavaScript Integration

In addition to the official Aptos Wallet Adapter libraries, Cosmostation also allows **direct integration using plain JavaScript**.

The exposed provider strictly follows the **Aptos Wallet Standard interface**, making it suitable for lightweight applications or environments where bundling external libraries is undesirable.

### Accessing the Aptos Provider

You can access the Cosmostation Aptos provider directly from the global `window` object.

```javascript
const isCosmostationInstalled = 'cosmostation' in window;

const getAptosProvider = () => {
  if ('cosmostation' in window) {
    return window.cosmostation.aptos;
  } else {
    // Redirect users to install the Cosmostation extension
    window.open('https://cosmostation.io/wallet/#extension');
    /**
     * Alternatively:
     * window.open(
     *   'https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cosmostation/fpkhgmpbidmiogeglndfbkegfdlnajnf'
     * );
     */
  }
};

const provider = getAptosProvider();
```
