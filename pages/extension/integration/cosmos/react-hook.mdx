import ConnectButton from '@/components/extension/hook/connect-button';

# React hook

## Installation

The Cosmostation wallet hook package lives in npm. To install the latest stable version, run the following command:

```bash
npm install @cosmostation/use-wallets
```

Or if you're using yarn:

```bash
yarn add @cosmostation/use-wallets
```

## CosmosProvider

Components that use cosmos wallet state need `CosmosProvider` to appear somewhere in the parent tree. A good place to put this is in your root component:

```jsx
import { CosmosProvider } from '@cosmostation/use-wallets';

function App() {
  return (
    <CosmosProvider>
      <MyApp />
    </CosmosProvider>
  );
}
```

<ConnectButton />
